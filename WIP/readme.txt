Work in progress of new design

Update log:

23/07/17
The schematic is almost done. Need to retink of some part of the logic part to protect the pyro cause it look like it can cause an oscilation (this part is not even up to date)
1.Add a buzzer.
2.Add poly fuse.
3.Add the logic circuit to protect the pyro. (see note on top)
4.Add latching circuit. (Hold 3s to power on/off)
5.Add many status leds. (one led can be placed externaly by a screw terminal)

This week I will try to list all the feature of this board, finalyze the schematic, add the data sheets of some ICs.
