Work in progress of new design

Update log:

I can say that the schematic is now done but it will need to be verified to but sure that everything is ok and avoid poor mistake.
1.Redesing of the logic circuit protection to be more secure
2.Add a different batteries for the RFD900 so if the RFD900 drain it the pyro still have its own power.
3.In link with the second point, now the pyro is on 4s lipo (14.8v)

The schematic is almost done. Need to retink of some part of the logic part to protect the pyro cause it look like it can cause an oscilation (this part is not even up to date)
1.Add a buzzer.
2.Add poly fuse.
3.Add the logic circuit to protect the pyro. (see note on top)
4.Add latching circuit. (Hold 3s to power on/off)
5.Add many status leds. (one led can be placed externaly by a screw terminal)

This week I will try to list all the feature of this board, finalyze the schematic, add the data sheets of some ICs.
